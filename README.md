# Gender-Recognition
Analysis of facial images using the dlib python library to implements accurate gender recognition and prediction using the implementation of numerous machine learning models

## Data Setup
The data used in this research, is from the [CelebA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset?resource=download-directory). Follow the data splitting procedure used to unsure equal testing and training sets. (The provided data set has more female images than male images, thus a paritition must be implemented to ensure accurate results)
## Dlib Library Configuration
Following the following [instructions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-dlib-library-for-python-in-windows-10/) to download the dlib library which will allow the extraction of features from images.
